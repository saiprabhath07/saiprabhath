<h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
For the 11th century battle in the Byzantine 
conquest of the Mezzogiorno, see Battle of Cannae (1018).

The Battle of Cannae (/ˈkæni, -eɪ, -aɪ/)[b] was a key engagement 
of the Second Punic War between the Roman Republic and Carthage,
 fought on 2 August 216 BC near the ancient village of Cannae in
 Apulia, southeast Italy. The Carthaginians and their allies, led 
 by Hannibal, surrounded and practically annihilated a larger 
 Roman and Italian army under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus
 and Gaius Terentius Varro. It is regarded as one of the greatest 
 tactical feats in military history and one of the worst defeats
 in Roman history.
</p>
<p>
Having recovered from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake 
Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at 
Cannae, with approximately 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They 
massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while 
Hannibal used the double envelopment tactic and surrounded his 
enemy, trapping the majority of the Roman army, who were then 
slaughtered. The loss of life on the Roman side was one of the 
most lethal single day's fighting in history; Adrian Goldsworthy 
equates the death toll at Cannae to "the massed slaughter of the 
British Army on the first day of the Somme offensive in 1916."[3]
 Only about 15,000 Romans, most of whom were from the garrisons of
 the camps and had not taken part in the battle, escaped death.
 Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states
 defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.
</p>
<h1>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
Never when the city was in safety was there so great a panic and 
confusion within the walls of Rome. I shall therefore shrink from
 the task, and not attempt to relate what in describing I must make
 less than the reality. The consul and his army having been lost at
 the Trasimenus the year before, it was not one wound upon another 
 which was announced, but a multiplied disaster, the loss of two 
 consular armies, together with the two consuls: and that now there
 was neither any Roman camp, nor general nor soldiery: that Apulia 
 and Samnium, and now almost the whole of Italy, were in the
 possession of Hannibal. No other nation surely would not have been
 overwhelmed by such an accumulation of misfortune.
 </p>
 <p>
 For a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their 
 best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants 
 severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro)
 completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a 
 national day of mourning as there was not a single person who 
 was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had 
 died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human 
 sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and
 abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of 
 the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from 
 3public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars)

<h1>Ancient Egypt - THE Pharoah</h1>
<p>
The Pharoah was a living god.  He was at the top of Ancient Egyptian society.  The pharoah
was responsible for the well being of his people and was obligated to keep the order. 
He was all powerful and he spent most of his time at the capital city of Memphis.  Here 
he administered control of both Lower and Upper Egypt.
</p>

<h1>The Tombs of the Pharoahs</h1>
<p>
The Pharoah spent most of his life working on his tomb.  The Pharoah's had this busy afterlife
where they continued to control the universe after their death.  The god Anubis assisted
the pharoah in the mummfication process.  After the pharoah died he traveled to the underworld
using the Book of the Dead.
